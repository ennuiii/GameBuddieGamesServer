# BingoBuddies Client Migration Summary

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED CLIENT UPDATES

### 1. Socket Connection ‚úÖ
**File**: `BingoBuddies/client/src/hooks/useSocket.tsx`
- Updated to connect to `/bingo` namespace on unified server
- Changed URL from `serverUrl` to `${serverUrl}/bingo`

### 2. Environment Configuration ‚úÖ
**File**: `BingoBuddies/client/.env`
- Created `.env` file
- Set `VITE_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3001`

### 3. Two-Step Room Creation ‚úÖ
**Files Updated:**
- `BingoBuddies/client/src/pages/HomePage.tsx`
  - `handleCreateRoom()` - Updated to use `room:create` ‚Üí `bingo:setup-game` flow
  - `handleCreateRoomWithGameData()` - Updated for GameBuddies integration
  - Both `handleJoinRoom()` functions - Changed `joinRoom` ‚Üí `room:join`

- `BingoBuddies/client/src/components/RootHandler.tsx`
  - Updated auto-create logic for GameBuddies (lines 54-115)
  - Updated auto-join logic (line 126)

### 4. Game Action Event Emitters ‚úÖ
All socket.emit calls updated with new event names:

| Component | Old Event | New Event | Line |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|------|
| LobbyView.tsx | `startGame` | `bingo:start-game` | 29 |
| LobbyView.tsx | `kickPlayer` | `player:kick` | 39 |
| LobbyView.tsx | `updateRoomSettings` | `bingo:update-settings` | 261 |
| InputPhaseView.tsx | `submitBingoCard` | `bingo:submit-card` | 42 |
| ReviewPhaseView.tsx | `startPlayingPhase` | `bingo:start-playing` | 17 |
| PlayingPhaseView.tsx | `markItem` | `bingo:mark-item` | 17 |
| FinishedPhaseView.tsx | `resetGame` | `bingo:reset-game` | 33 |

### 5. Event Listeners - ALREADY COMPATIBLE ‚úÖ
**File**: `BingoBuddies/client/src/hooks/useSocketEvents.tsx`

The client already listens for the correct events that the plugin emits:
- ‚úÖ `roomStateUpdated` - Plugin emits this
- ‚úÖ `gamePhaseChanged` - Plugin emits this
- ‚úÖ `bingoCardSubmitted` - Plugin emits this
- ‚úÖ `bingoCardUpdated` - Plugin emits this
- ‚úÖ `itemMarked` - Plugin emits this (data structure matches)
- ‚úÖ `winnerDeclared` - Plugin emits this (data structure matches)
- ‚úÖ `playerJoined` - Core emits this
- ‚úÖ `playerLeft` - Core emits this
- ‚úÖ `error` - Both core and plugin emit this
- ‚úÖ `gamebuddies:return-all` - Core emits this

**No changes needed to useSocketEvents.tsx!** The event listener names already match what the unified server emits.

## üêõ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Client Can't Connect
**Symptoms**: "Connecting..." status persists
**Check:**
1. Unified server is running on port 3001
2. `.env` file exists with `VITE_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3001`
3. No CORS errors in browser console

**Fix:**
```bash
# Kill any process on port 3001
npx kill-port 3001

# Restart unified server
cd E:\GamebuddiesPlatform\unified-game-server
npm run dev
```

### Issue: Room Creation Fails
**Symptoms**: Error message after clicking "Create Room"
**Check Server Console For:**
- Plugin loaded successfully?
- Namespace registered?
- Any error logs?

**Common Causes:**
1. Plugin not registered in `core/server.ts`
2. Import path incorrect
3. TypeScript compilation errors

### Issue: Events Not Working
**Symptoms**: Clicks don't do anything, phase doesn't change
**Check:**
1. Browser console for errors
2. Server console for received events
3. Network tab for WebSocket frames

**Debug:**
```javascript
// Add to client console
socket.on('*', (event, data) => {
  console.log('Received:', event, data);
});

socket.emit = new Proxy(socket.emit, {
  apply(target, thisArg, args) {
    console.log('Emitting:', args[0], args[1]);
    return Reflect.apply(target, thisArg, args);
  }
});
```

### Issue: Data Structure Mismatch
**Symptoms**: UI partially renders, some data undefined
**Check:**
1. Browser console for `undefined` warnings
2. Compare serialized data vs client expectations
3. Check `serializeRoomToClient()` function in plugin
