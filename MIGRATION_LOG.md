# Unified Game Server - Migration Log

This document tracks the migration of games from standalone servers to the unified game server architecture.

## Overview

The unified game server provides a plugin-based architecture where games run in isolated Socket.io namespaces while sharing common infrastructure:

- **Room/Lobby Management** - Handled by RoomManager
- **Chat System** - Built into room.messages
- **WebRTC Coordination** - Tracked via room.videoEnabledPeers
- **GameBuddies Integration** - Managed by GameBuddiesService
- **Session Management** - Handled by SessionManager

Each game plugin only needs to implement game-specific logic.

## ClueScale Migration

**Date:** 2025-10-24 (Updated - Full Implementation)
**Status:** ✅ Complete (Server + Client)
**Namespace:** `/clue`
**Estimated Time:** 7-11 hours
**Actual Time:** ~8 hours

### Summary

Successfully migrated ClueScale (1-10 scale guessing game) from standalone server (1,690 lines) to unified game server plugin using the "Direct Core Integration" pattern. Game features clue-based guessing, role rotation, round-based gameplay, and team scoring mechanics. Migration completed with parallel agent coordination (server architect + frontend developer).

### Files Created

#### Server-Side
1. **`/games/clue/types/index.ts`** (98 lines)
   - ClueScale-specific type definitions
   - Extends core Room and Player types
   - Defines: ClueGameState, CluePlayerData, Round, Guess, ClueSettings

     - `round:skip-turn` - Skip current turn with penalty (host only)
     - `settings:update` - Update game settings (lobby only, host only)
     - `game:restart` - Reset game state (host only)
     - `player:kick` - Remove player (host only)
   - Lifecycle hooks (6 total):
     - `onRoomCreate()` - Initialize ClueGameState with empty round, role queue
     - `onPlayerJoin()` - Initialize CluePlayerData with score 0
     - `onPlayerLeave()` - Clear timers if clue giver leaves, remove from role queue
     - `onGameStart()` - Optional logging
     - `onGameEnd()` - Clear all timers
     - `onCleanup()` - Plugin shutdown cleanup

### Files Modified

#### Server-Side
1. **`/core/server.ts`**
   - Line 28: Added `import { cluePlugin } from '../games/clue/plugin.js'`
   - Lines 631-637: Registered CluePlugin with server

#### Client-Side
1. **`E:\GamebuddiesPlatform\ClueScale\client\src\services\socketService.ts`**
   - Updated socket connection to `/clue` namespace
   - Added session token storage and retrieval (`clue_session_token`)
   - Updated reconnection logic to use `room:join` with session token
   - Added mobile optimization options (timeout: 20000, multiplex: true)

2. **`E:\GamebuddiesPlatform\ClueScale\client\src\App.tsx`**
   - Implemented two-step room creation:
     - Step 1: `room:create` with generic settings (minPlayers, maxPlayers)
     - Step 2: `clue:setup-game` with full ClueScale settings
   - Updated event listeners to unified server patterns:
     - `room:created` + `clue:game-setup` - Room creation complete
     - `room:joined` - Player joined with session token
     - `player:joined` - Another player joined
     - `player:left` - Player left room
     - `player:disconnected` - Player connection lost
   - Added `pendingRoomSettings` state for two-step creation flow
   - Session token storage on room creation and join

3. **`E:\GamebuddiesPlatform\ClueScale\client\src\components\DisconnectWarning.tsx`**
   - Updated event listeners from lobby events to player events
   - `lobby:player-disconnected` → `player:disconnected`
   - `lobby:player-left` → `player:left`

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Direct Core Integration Pattern** (Different from SUSD)
   - Uses core Room directly instead of separate room mapping
   - GameManager has pure functions that operate on core rooms
   - No internal room wrapper needed (simpler than SUSD approach)
   - Benefits: Less boilerplate, easier testing, clearer code

2. **Player Identity Management** (Critical for Reconnection)
   - Uses stable `player.id` (UUID) in game logic, not `socketId`
   - Role queue stores player IDs (persists across reconnections)
   - Socket ID only used for communication (helpers.sendToPlayer)
   - Ensures game state survives player reconnections

3. **State Management Pattern**
   - Game state stored in `room.gameState.data` (cast to ClueGameState)
   - Player data stored in `player.gameData` (cast to CluePlayerData)
   - Timer stored in game state for cleanup on player leave
   - No duplicate state (single source of truth in core Room)

4. **Role Rotation System**
   - Maintains circular queue of player IDs in `gameState.roleQueue`
   - Auto-refreshes queue on game start with connected players
   - Shifts first player to end after each round
   - Handles player disconnection gracefully

5. **Timer Management** (Comprehensive Cleanup)
   - Round timers stored in game state as NodeJS.Timeout
   - Dual-purpose timer handles both clue and guess phases
   - Cleared in multiple lifecycle points:
     - onPlayerLeave (if clue giver leaves)
     - onGameEnd (game cleanup)
     - Before setting new timer (prevent duplicates)
     - When all guesses are in (early reveal)

6. **Two-Step Room Creation** (Client-Side)
   - Step 1: Core creates generic room (`room:create`)
   - Step 2: Plugin sets up game data (`clue:setup-game`)
   - Allows core to create room before game-specific logic runs
   - Client stores pending settings between steps

7. **Validation Approach**
   - All game-specific validation in plugin handlers
   - Clue validation: single word, no numbers, non-empty, clue giver only
   - Guess validation: 1-10 range, one guess per player, not clue giver
   - Permission validation: host checks for all admin actions
   - Phase validation: lobby for settings, round phases for gameplay

### What Was Migrated

✅ Game-specific types (ClueGameState, Round, Guess, Settings)
✅ Scoring algorithms (guesser points, team bonus, clue giver points)
✅ Round management (start, timeout, reveal, next)
✅ Role rotation logic (circular queue)
✅ Socket event handlers (8 game-specific events)
✅ Timer management (round phases)
✅ Validation logic (clue format, guess range, permissions)

### What Was Leveraged (NOT Migrated)

❌ Room/Lobby system - Used RoomManager
❌ Chat functionality - Used room.messages
❌ WebRTC coordination - Used room.videoEnabledPeers
❌ GameBuddies integration - Used GameBuddiesService
❌ Player session management - Used SessionManager
❌ Socket.io server setup - Plugin registered with existing server

### Testing Status

- ✅ TypeScript compilation - All files compile successfully
- ✅ Code review - Server and client implementation verified
- ✅ Event coverage - All old server events migrated to unified patterns
- ✅ No old server references - Client search confirms clean migration
- ⏳ Runtime testing - Pending manual test of full game flow
- ⏳ Multi-round gameplay - Pending test
- ⏳ Role rotation - Pending test
- ⏳ Scoring calculations - Pending test
- ⏳ Reconnection handling - Pending test
- ⏳ WebRTC integration - Pending test

### Migration Notes

- Original server: 1,690 lines (ClueScale/server/server.ts)
- Game logic extracted: ~973 lines (types + scoring + GameManager + plugin)
- Lines saved by leveraging infrastructure: ~717 lines (42% reduction)
- Client-side changes: Moderate (3 files updated for two-step creation and event patterns)
- Code quality improvements: Added comprehensive logging, error handling, input validation
- TypeScript fixes: Fixed 4 pre-existing errors in core server and SUSD plugin
- Documentation: Created comprehensive architectural decision document

### Event Mapping (Client Updates)

**Old Standalone Server → New Unified Server:**
- `lobby:create` → `room:create` + `clue:setup-game` (two-step)
- `lobby:created` → `room:created` + `clue:game-setup` (two-step)
- `lobby:join` → `room:join`
- `lobby:joined` → `room:joined`
- `lobby:player-joined` → `player:joined`
- `lobby:player-left` → `player:left`
- `lobby:player-disconnected` → `player:disconnected`
- Game events unchanged: `game:start`, `round:*`, `settings:*`

### Parallel Agent Coordination

This migration used two specialized agents working in parallel:
- **unified-server-architect**: Completed server plugin implementation
- **frontend-game-client-developer**: Updated client for unified server

Both agents completed their work independently and integration was verified through:
- TypeScript compilation checks
- Event coverage verification
- Old server reference searches

    - Added `VITE_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3001`

### Critical Bug Discovery & Fix

**⚠️ THE CRITICAL BUG:**

**Symptom:** Player2 join request timed out with "Join timed out - please try again" even though:
- Server successfully created session
- Server successfully added player to room
- Server successfully emitted `room:joined` event
- Server logs showed no errors

**Root Cause:**
`useSocketEvents()` was only called in `GamePage.tsx`. When Player2 tried to join a room, they were on `HomePage.tsx`, so the event listeners were NOT registered yet. The `room:joined` event was emitted by the server but never received by the client because no listener was active.

**The Fix:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (GamePage.tsx) - ❌ WRONG
import { useSocketEvents } from '@/hooks/useSocketEvents'

const GamePage: React.FC<GamePageProps> = ({ roomCodeFromUrl }) => {
  useSocketEvents() // Only active when GamePage is mounted!
  // ...
}

// AFTER (App.tsx) - ✅ CORRECT
import { useSocketEvents } from './hooks/useSocketEvents'

function AppContent() {
  const { socket, isConnected } = useSocket()

  // Setup socket event listeners (must be active at all times)
  useSocketEvents() // ✅ Always active from app initialization

  // ...
}
```

**Impact:**
This bug would affect ANY multiplayer React game where:
- Event listeners are conditionally registered based on page/route
- Players can join from different pages than where they create rooms
- Socket events are emitted but never received

**Key Lesson:**
- Socket event listeners must be registered in a component that is ALWAYS mounted
- Don't rely on page components for global event handling
- Test the full user journey (create → join from different tab/window)
- Server logs showing success doesn't guarantee client received the event

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Direct Core Integration Pattern**
   - Same as ClueScale, simpler than SUSD wrapper
   - Game logic operates directly on core Room objects
   - No internal room mapping needed

2. **Event Listener Placement (Critical)**
   - Global event listeners MUST be in `App.tsx`, not page components
   - Ensures listeners are active regardless of current route
   - Prevents missed events due to component lifecycle

3. **Serialization Strategy**
   - Created `serializeRoomToLobby` function for all room emissions
   - Converts server `Map<string, Player>` to client `Player[]`
   - Maps phase strings to client enum values
   - Adds client-specific fields like `mySocketId`

4. **Two-Step Room Creation**
   - Step 1: Core creates base room (`room:create`)
   - Step 2: Plugin initializes game data (`bingo:setup-game`)
   - Client stores pending settings between steps

### What Was Migrated

✅ Game-specific types (BingoGameState, BingoCard, Settings)
✅ All 5 game phases (lobby, input, review, playing, finished)
✅ Card submission and validation
✅ Item marking with win detection (row, column, diagonal)
✅ Socket event handlers (8 game-specific events)
✅ Host controls (settings, phase transitions, reset)

### What Was Leveraged (NOT Migrated)

❌ Room/Lobby system - Used RoomManager
❌ Chat functionality - Used room.messages
❌ WebRTC coordination - Used room.videoEnabledPeers
❌ GameBuddies integration - Used GameBuddiesService
❌ Player session management - Used SessionManager

### Testing Status

**Test Environment:**
- Unified Server: http://localhost:3001
- BingoBuddies Client: http://localhost:5173
- Testing: Manual testing with 2 browser tabs

**Test Results:**
- ✅ Server startup and plugin loading
- ✅ Client connection to `/bingo` namespace
- ✅ Room creation (two-step process)
- ✅ Player2 joining (AFTER bug fix)
- ✅ Both players visible in lobby
- ✅ Start Game button enabled with 2+ players
- ✅ Transition to Input Phase
- ✅ 3x3 grid display (9 textboxes)
- ✅ Progress tracking (0/9 filled, 0/2 submitted)
- ⏳ Card submission - Pending (next test)
- ⏳ Review phase - Pending
- ⏳ Playing phase with marking - Pending
- ⏳ Win detection - Pending
- ⏳ Reconnection handling - Pending

**Room Created:** MGNY4D
**Players:** Host1 (host), Player2 (joined successfully)
**Status:** Both players in lobby, ready to fill cards

### Migration Notes

- Original standalone server: Yes (BingoBuddies had server)
- Lines of server code migrated: ~665 lines (plugin only)
- Lines saved by leveraging infrastructure: ~500+ lines
- Client-side changes: 11 files updated
- Critical bugs discovered: 1 (event listener placement)
- Documentation created: 3 comprehensive markdown files

### Event Mapping

**Old → New:**
- `createRoom` → `room:create` + `bingo:setup-game`
- `joinRoom` → `room:join`
- Game events (bingo:*) remained the same, just using unified namespace

**Core Events Leveraged:**
- `room:created`, `room:joined` - Handled by core
- `player:joined`, `player:left` - Handled by core
- `chat:message` - Handled by core

## Lessons Learned

### From ClueScale Migration

1. **Choose the Right Pattern**
   - SUSD uses "Game Manager Wrapper" with separate internal rooms
   - ClueScale uses "Direct Core Integration" operating on core rooms
   - Choose based on game complexity:
     - Simple games (ClueScale): Use Direct Core Integration
     - Complex games with many modes (SUSD): Use Game Manager Wrapper

2. **Player Identity is Critical**
   - Always use `player.id` (UUID) in game logic, never `socketId`
   - Socket IDs change on reconnection, player IDs are stable
   - This enables proper reconnection handling
   - Store player IDs in role queues, turn orders, etc.

3. **Two-Step Room Creation**
   - Core creates generic room first
   - Plugin sets up game-specific data second
   - Client needs state management between steps
   - Allows clear separation between infrastructure and game logic

4. **Comprehensive Timer Cleanup**
   - Clear timers in onPlayerLeave (especially if that player is active)
   - Clear timers in onGameEnd
   - Clear before setting new timer (prevent duplicates)
   - Clear on early completion (e.g., all guesses in)

5. **Event Migration Pattern**
   - Core events use colons: `room:*`, `player:*`, `chat:*`, `webrtc:*`
   - Game events can use colons or hyphens: `game:start`, `round:submit-guess`
   - Document event mappings for client developers
   - Search client codebase to ensure no old events remain

6. **Parallel Agent Coordination**
   - Server and client can be updated simultaneously
   - Use specialized agents (unified-server-architect, frontend-game-client-developer)
   - Define clear contracts (event names, payloads)
   - Verify integration with compilation checks and reference searches

7. **Code Quality from Day One**
   - Add comprehensive logging with clear prefixes
   - Implement thorough error handling in all handlers
   - Validate all inputs (permissions, phases, values)
   - Document architectural decisions immediately

8. **Fix Pre-Existing Issues**
   - Use migration as opportunity to fix existing TypeScript errors
   - Update type definitions if needed (e.g., gameBuddiesData on Room)
   - Clean up tech debt in related files
   - Ensure compilation passes completely
